To fix this, ensure the container element has defined dimensions (height and width) and explicitly set the `background-size` property.  If the image should cover the entire container, use `background-size: cover;`. If you want to maintain aspect ratio, use `background-size: contain;`. Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  position: relative;
}

.container::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
}
```

This corrected code ensures that the background image is correctly displayed.
